Group\n\n## 1 Project Summary\nThis project investigates the ecological impacts of rapid urbanization in Shenzhen by leveraging multi-source remote sensing data and geospatial analysis on the Google Earth Engine platform. Through the integration of spectral indices such as NDBBI, EVI, MNDWI, BSI, and land surface temperature (LST), combined with land cover classification and time-series analysis at both monthly and annual scales, the study captures spatial patterns and temporal trends of key surface changes. In addition, nighttime light intensity and NO₂ concentration data are incorporated to assess the relationship between urban expansion, human activities, and environmental quality. The results provide dynamic, multi-dimensional evidence to support sustainable urban planning and ecological management.\n\n## 2 Introduction\n\n### 2.1 Background\nShenzhen, located in the Pearl River Delta region of southern China, has experienced rapid urbanization and economic transformation over the past few decades, evolving from a small fishing village into a major global metropolis. While this urban growth has generated significant economic prosperity, it has also led to substantial environmental challenges, including intensified urban heat island effects, declining vegetation cover, water quality degradation, and increased air pollution. Understanding and addressing these ecological impacts are essential for promoting sustainable urban development and safeguarding the quality of life for residents.\n\n### 2.2 Literature review\nUrbanization significantly alters land surface characteristics, influencing local climate, hydrology, and biodiversity (Seto et al., 2012; Grimm et al., 2008). Urban expansion has been strongly linked to intensified urban heat island effects, with vegetation playing a crucial role in regulating urban microclimates (Zhou et al., 2017). The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) has proven effective for assessing vegetation health and ecological conditions in urban environments (Huete et al., 2002).\n\nUrban growth often leads to the loss of permeable surfaces, increased surface runoff, and degradation of water quality, challenges that can be effectively monitored through indices such as the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) (Xu, 2006). Similarly, the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBBI) and the Bare Soil Index (BSI) offer quantitative means to characterize urban development and its ecological impacts (Zha et al., 2003).\n\nNighttime light imagery has emerged as a valuable proxy for urbanization intensity and human activities, correlating with patterns of energy consumption and environmental stress (Elvidge et al., 2013). The increasing availability of long-term satellite observations, particularly from Landsat and MODIS platforms, has further facilitated the analysis of urban ecological dynamics over time (Weng et al., 2014).Recent advances in time-series remote sensing analysis have enabled more detailed tracking of urban ecological changes across different temporal scales, facilitating the identification of seasonal and interannual patterns (Zhu & Woodcock, 2014).\n\nFurthermore, urban land expansion has been associated with rising levels of atmospheric pollutants, such as NO₂, especially in rapidly developing metropolitan areas (Zheng et al., 2018). The integration of remote sensing data with machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest classifiers, has significantly enhanced the accuracy and scalability of urban land cover mapping (Belgiu & Drăguţ, 2016).\n\n## 3 Problem Statement \n\nHow does urbanization impact Shenzhen’s surface and environmental conditions over time?\n\nObjective:\nTo build an interactive monitoring and analysis platform that utilizes high-resolution, multi-temporal remote sensing datasets through the Google Earth Engine platform. By integrating indices such as NDBBI, EVI, BSI, MNDWI, and LST with machine learning-based land cover classification, the project identifies spatial patterns and temporal trends of key ecological indicators. It further quantifies the relationships between urban expansion and environmental variables—such as vegetation degradation, surface warming, water body shrinkage, nighttime light intensification, and NO₂ concentration changes—providing dynamic, multi-scale evidence to support sustainable urban planning and environmental management.\n\n## 4 End User \n\nUrban planners, environmental agencies, and local policymakers in Shenzhen\n\nThis application is designed to support urban planning departments and ecological management agencies by providing accurate, timely, and spatially-explicit data on the ecological effects of urbanization. By visualizing key indicators such as vegetation coverage (EVI), land surface temperature (LST), and impervious surface extent (NDBBI), the platform helps stakeholders monitor ecological changes, identify vulnerable areas, and evaluate the effectiveness of urban greening or mitigation strategies. The insights also empower policy decisions related to sustainable development, land-use regulation, climate adaptation, and public health interventions in rapidly urbanizing areas.\n\n## 5 Data\n\n\n| **Data Type**                      | **Dataset & Source**                                                  | **Usage**                                                                     | **Time Period**                     |\n|:-----------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------|\n| **Surface Reflectance & Surface Temperature** | `LANDSAT/LC08/C02/T1_L2` – USGS Landsat 8 Collection 2 Tier 1 Level 2 | Calculation of spectral indices (EVI, NDBBI, BSI, MNDWI) and land surface temperature (LST); used for classification and temporal analysis | 2013–2023 (Classification focused on 2020) |\n| **Digital Elevation Model & Terrain Attributes** | `USGS/SRTMGL1_003` – NASA SRTM DEM (30 m)                             | Extraction of slope and aspect for topographic correction of EVI             | Static (Global DEM)                 |\n| **Nighttime Lights**              | `NOAA/VIIRS/DNB/MONTHLY_V1/VCMSLCFG` – VIIRS Monthly DNB              | Monitoring of urban activity intensity and temporal urbanization trends     | 2013–2023                           |\n| **Tropospheric NO₂ Concentration** | `COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3_NO2` – Sentinel-5P TROPOMI                    | Assessment of urban-related atmospheric pollution                            | 2018–2023                           |\n| **Administrative Boundaries**     | `FAO/GAUL_SIMPLIFIED_500m/2015/level2` – FAO GAUL Level 2             | Definition of region of interest (Shenzhen) for spatial analysis             | Static (Snapshot in 2015)            |\n\n\n## 6 Methodology\n\nFlow chart\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart TD\n  A[\"Data Acquisition\"]\n  B[\"Preprocessing (SR & LST Calibration)\"]\n  B1[\"Cloud Masking (maskL8sr)\"]\n  C[\"Spectral Index Calculation (EVI, NDBBI, MNDWI, BSI)\"]\n  D[\"Terrain Correction (only for EVI)\"]\n\n  E[\"Land Cover Classification:\n  - Built-up\n  - 4 Vegetation levels\n  - Water\n  - Other\"]\n\n  V[\"Validation Sample Collection\n  (Stratified random sampling)\"]\n\n  F1[\"Monthly Time-Series Analysis\"]\n  F2[\"Annual Trend Analysis (2013-2023)\"]\n\n  G1[\"Monthly Metrics:\n  - EVI/NDBBI/LST\n  - Nighttime Lights\n  - NO₂ (post-2018)\"]\n  \n  G2[\"Annual Metrics:\n  - Built-up growth rate\n  - Vegetation loss\n  - LST trends\n  - NO₂ correlation\"]\n\n  ACC[\"Accuracy Validation:\n  - OA=94.2%\n  - Kappa=0.911\"]\n\n  H[\"Statistical Analysis:\n  - Area calculation\n  - Change detection\"]\n\n  I[\"Correlation Analysis:\n  - EVI vs NDBBI\n  - LST vs Built-up\n  - NO₂ vs Urbanization\"]\n\n  J[\"Interactive Visualization:\n  - Year slider control\n  - 3 analysis panels\n  - Dynamic charts\n  - Legend display\"]\n\n  A --> B\n  B --> B1\n  B1 --> C\n  C -->|NDBBI/BSI/MNDWI| E\n  C -->|EVI| D --> E\n  E --> V\n  V --> ACC\n  E --> F1\n  E --> F2\n  F1 <--> F2\n  F1 --> G1\n  F2 --> G2\n  G1 --> H\n  G2 --> H\n  H --> I\n  I --> J\n```\n\nHow are you using this data to address the problem?\n\nBy preprocessing multi-source remote sensing data and calculating key ecological indices (EVI, NDBBI, MNDWI, BSI, LST), we classify land cover types, track monthly and annual changes, and analyze the relationships between urban expansion, environmental degradation, and human activities.

Although these indicators effectively capture surface conditions, they inevitably simplify complex ecological and socioeconomic processes. Spectral indices and land cover classifications, while quantitatively robust, may not fully reflect the functional diversity and fine-scale heterogeneity of urban ecosystems.\n\nSecond, the project focuses mainly on biophysical variables such as vegetation dynamics, water distribution, surface temperature, and built-up expansion. Broader socioeconomic factors—such as demographic shifts, policy interventions, and industrial restructuring—are not directly incorporated, which limits a holistic understanding of urbanization impacts.\n\nFinally, the reliance on satellite-based observations introduces inherent temporal and spatial limitations, particularly in capturing rapid micro-scale changes in dense urban environments. The constraints of GEE's cloud computing environment, including processing quotas, data resolution, and algorithm flexibility, may also affect the depth and customization of the analysis.\n\n## 10 Future work\nBuilding on the current framework, several directions could enhance the depth and breadth of future research.\n\nFirst, integrating socioeconomic datasets—such as census data, land use planning records, and economic activity indicators—would allow a more comprehensive understanding of the drivers and consequences of urban ecological changes. Coupling remote sensing data with socioeconomic analysis could reveal more nuanced patterns of urbanization.\n\nSecond, improving spatial and temporal resolution is crucial. The use of higher-resolution imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2, commercial satellite data) or fusion methods could better capture fine-scale variations, particularly in highly heterogeneous urban cores. Incorporating more frequent observations would also enhance the reliability of time-series analysis, especially for detecting rapid or seasonal changes.\n\nLast, expanding the analysis beyond surface conditions to include water quality metrics, or biodiversity indices could provide a fuller ecological profile. Integrating multiple environmental dimensions would move the assessment closer to ecosystem health evaluation rather than surface characterization alone.\n\n## 11 Reference\n\nBelgiu, M., & Drăguţ, L.
