## 1 Project Summary
This project investigates the ecological impacts of rapid urbanization in Shenzhen by leveraging multi-source remote sensing data and geospatial analysis on the Google Earth Engine platform. Through the integration of spectral indices such as NDBBI, EVI, MNDWI, BSI, and land surface temperature (LST), combined with land cover classification and time-series analysis at both monthly and annual scales, the study captures spatial patterns and temporal trends of key surface changes. In addition, nighttime light intensity and NO₂ concentration data are incorporated to assess the relationship between urban expansion, human activities, and environmental quality. The results provide dynamic, multi-dimensional evidence to support sustainable urban planning and ecological management.

## 2 Introduction

### 2.1 Background
Shenzhen, located in the Pearl River Delta region of southern China, has experienced rapid urbanization and economic transformation over the past few decades, evolving from a small fishing village into a major global metropolis. While this urban growth has generated significant economic prosperity, it has also led to substantial environmental challenges, including intensified urban heat island effects, declining vegetation cover, water quality degradation, and increased air pollution. Understanding and addressing these ecological impacts are essential for promoting sustainable urban development and safeguarding the quality of life for residents.

### 2.2 Literature review
Urbanization significantly alters land surface characteristics, influencing local climate, hydrology, and biodiversity (Seto et al., 2012; Grimm et al., 2008). Urban expansion has been strongly linked to intensified urban heat island effects, with vegetation playing a crucial role in regulating urban microclimates (Zhou et al., 2017). The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) has proven effective for assessing vegetation health and ecological conditions in urban environments (Huete et al., 2002).

Urban growth often leads to the loss of permeable surfaces, increased surface runoff, and degradation of water quality, challenges that can be effectively monitored through indices such as the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) (Xu, 2006). Similarly, the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBBI) and the Bare Soil Index (BSI) offer quantitative means to characterize urban development and its ecological impacts (Zha et al., 2003).

Nighttime light imagery has emerged as a valuable proxy for urbanization intensity and human activities, correlating with patterns of energy consumption and environmental stress (Elvidge et al., 2013). The increasing availability of long-term satellite observations, particularly from Landsat and MODIS platforms, has further facilitated the analysis of urban ecological dynamics over time (Weng et al., 2014).Recent advances in time-series remote sensing analysis have enabled more detailed tracking of urban ecological changes across different temporal scales, facilitating the identification of seasonal and interannual patterns (Zhu & Woodcock, 2014).

Furthermore, urban land expansion has been associated with rising levels of atmospheric pollutants, such as NO₂, especially in rapidly developing metropolitan areas (Zheng et al., 2018). The integration of remote sensing data with machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest classifiers, has significantly enhanced the accuracy and scalability of urban land cover mapping (Belgiu & Drăguţ, 2016).

## 3 Problem Statement 

How does urbanization impact Shenzhen’s surface and environmental conditions over time?

Objective:
To build an interactive monitoring and analysis platform that utilizes high-resolution, multi-temporal remote sensing datasets through the Google Earth Engine platform. By integrating indices such as NDBBI, EVI, BSI, MNDWI, and LST with machine learning-based land cover classification, the project identifies spatial patterns and temporal trends of key ecological indicators. It further quantifies the relationships between urban expansion and environmental variables—such as vegetation degradation, surface warming, water body shrinkage, nighttime light intensification, and NO₂ concentration changes—providing dynamic, multi-scale evidence to support sustainable urban planning and environmental management.

## 4 End User 

Urban planners, environmental agencies, and local policymakers in Shenzhen

This application is designed to support urban planning departments and ecological management agencies by providing accurate, timely, and spatially-explicit data on the ecological effects of urbanization. By visualizing key indicators such as vegetation coverage (EVI), land surface temperature (LST), and impervious surface extent (NDBBI), the platform helps stakeholders monitor ecological changes, identify vulnerable areas, and evaluate the effectiveness of urban greening or mitigation strategies. The insights also empower policy decisions related to sustainable development, land-use regulation, climate adaptation, and public health interventions in rapidly urbanizing areas.

How are you using this data to address the problem?

By preprocessing multi-source remote sensing data and calculating key ecological indices (EVI, NDBBI, MNDWI, BSI, LST), we classify land cover types, track monthly and annual changes, and analyze the relationships between urban expansion, environmental degradation, and human activities. This integrated approach provides spatial-temporal evidence to understand and quantify the ecological impacts of Shenzhen’s rapid urbanization.

### 7.1 Data pre-processing

In this project, Shenzhen City is taken as the study area, and the year 2020 is selected as an example to use multi-source remote sensing data for surface cover classification and change analysis. Firstly, the boundary of Shenzhen City was extracted from the FAO GAUL database and centred. Subsequently, Landsat 8 data preprocessing, including cloud masking, radiometric correction and cropping to the study area, was performed.

```javascript
var gaul = ee.FeatureCollection('FAO/GAUL_SIMPLIFIED_500m/2015/level2');
var roi = gaul.filter(ee.Filter.eq('ADM2_NAME', 'Shenzhen'));
Map.centerObject(roi, 11);

// Cloud masking and radiometric correction
function maskL8sr(image) {
  var qa = image.select('QA_PIXEL');
  var cloudBitMask = 1 << 3;
  var shadowBitMask = 1 << 4;
  var mask = qa.bitwiseAnd(cloudBitMask).eq(0)
              .and(qa.bitwiseAnd(shadowBitMask).eq(0));
  
  var optical = image.select('SR_B.').multiply(0.0000275).add(-0.2);
  var thermal = image.select('ST_B.*').multiply(0.00341802).add(149.0);

  return image.addBands(optical, null, true)
              .addBands(thermal, null, true)
              .updateMask(mask)
              .clip(roi);
}
```

### 7.2 Surface Cover Classification, Statistics and Verifiation

- Calculate a variety of environmental indices;
- Setting thresholds to extract masks for different feature types;
- Superimpose each mask to generate a single-band classification image (Land Cover Map) and visualise it according to preset colours;
- Statistics;

```javascript
 // MNDWI: Normalised water body index, which enhances the distinction of water bodies from other features and is used to extract water body boundaries
  mndwi = image.expression(
    '(GREEN - SWIR1) / (GREEN + SWIR1)', bandMap
  ).rename('MNDWI');
  
  // EVI: Enhanced Vegetation Index, which performs better in areas of high vegetation cover and reduces atmospheric and soil background disturbances.
  evi = image.expression(
    '(2.5 * (NIRc - REDc)) / (NIRc + 6 * REDc - 7.5 * BLUE + 1)',
    {
      NIRc: nir_corrected,
      REDc: red_corrected,
      BLUE: blue_corrected
    }
  ).rename('EVI');

  // NDBBI: Normalised Building Index, highlighting artificial built-up areas through the difference between SWIR2 and NIR/green light
  ndbbi = image.expression(
    '(1.5 * SWIR2 - ((NIR + GREEN)/2)) / (1.5 * SWIR2 + ((NIR + GREEN)/2))',
    bandMap
  ).rename('NDBBI');

  // BSI: Bare Soil Index, combining visible and short-wave infrared reflectance for identifying areas of bare soil or sediment.
  var bsi = image.expression(
    '((RED + SWIR1) - (NIR + BLUE)) / ((RED + SWIR1) + (NIR + BLUE))',
    bandMap
  ).rename('BSI');

  // RI: Red-to-blue ratio index, which emphasises certain surface features by the ratio of red to blue light reflectance.
  var ri = image.expression('(RED - BLUE) / (RED + BLUE)', bandMap).rename('RI');

- Verification;

About 10 validation points were evenly selected for each class in the study area, and after manual interpretation, they were used for accuracy assessment. By comparing the classification results with the validation samples, the following accuracy metrics were obtained:

### 7.3 Annual trend analysis of land cover types
By analysing annual trends in land cover types, we can quantify the rate of urban land expansion and monitor the decline or recovery of vegetation and water bodies, thus providing a dynamic and quantitative scientific basis for urban planning and ecological restoration.

### 7.4 Correlation Analysis
Our group also conducted a correlation analysis for several groups of environmental indices. We first calculated the annual mean for each environmental index, then set the sampling pixel size to 30 by 30 and randomly sampled 2,000 points for correlation analysis.

- EVI vs NOBBI
![](images/7.4-1.jpg){width="100%"}
First, for the relationship between EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) and NDBBI, the two consistently show a significant negative correlation in the overall trend, which indicates that the higher the vegetation cover, the lower the proportion of built-up land, and vice versa. In other words, the more urbanized an area is, the lower the vegetation cover is, and this basic relationship remains stable between years. At the same time, as urbanization progresses, the scatter points begin to show more discrete points, possibly reflecting an increased tendency for urban expansion to lead to a decrease in vegetation cover, i.e., more low-vegetation, high-construction areas.

- NOBBI vs LST
![](images/7.4-2.jpg){width="100%"}
Similarly, there is always a positive correlation between NDBBI and LST, i.e., the higher the proportion of built-up land, the higher the surface temperature. With the development of urbanization, the effect of built-up land on temperature increase becomes more significant.

- LST vs EVI
![](images/7.4-3.jpg){width="100%"}
For the relationship between EVI and LST, the change is very obvious, from 2016 to 2023, the trend gradually evolves from a weak correlation to a strong negative correlation, i.e., the more vegetation there is, the lower the surface temperature is.The scatterplot for 16 years shows a very loose distribution, with the regression line being almost horizontal, and even showing signs of a slight positive correlation. However, as the city expands, the role of vegetation cover becomes more and more critical in reducing surface temperature, and the spatial differences in the urban heat island effect are more clearly amplified.

## 9 Limitations

While this project provides a comprehensive and dynamic exploration of urban ecological changes in Shenzhen, several limitations should be acknowledged.

First, the analysis is primarily based on remote sensing-derived indicators processed on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Although these indicators effectively capture surface conditions, they inevitably simplify complex ecological and socioeconomic processes. Spectral indices and land cover classifications, while quantitatively robust, may not fully reflect the functional diversity and fine-scale heterogeneity of urban ecosystems.

Second, the project focuses mainly on biophysical variables such as vegetation dynamics, water distribution, surface temperature, and built-up expansion. Broader socioeconomic factors—such as demographic shifts, policy interventions, and industrial restructuring—are not directly incorporated, which limits a holistic understanding of urbanization impacts.

Finally, the reliance on satellite-based observations introduces inherent temporal and spatial limitations, particularly in capturing rapid micro-scale changes in dense urban environments. The constraints of GEE's cloud computing environment, including processing quotas, data resolution, and algorithm flexibility, may also affect the depth and customization of the analysis.

## 10 Future work
Building on the current framework, several directions could enhance the depth and breadth of future research.

First, integrating socioeconomic datasets—such as census data, land use planning records, and economic activity indicators—would allow a more comprehensive understanding of the drivers and consequences of urban ecological changes. Coupling remote sensing data with socioeconomic analysis could reveal more nuanced patterns of urbanization.

Second, improving spatial and temporal resolution is crucial. The use of higher-resolution imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2, commercial satellite data) or fusion methods could better capture fine-scale variations, particularly in highly heterogeneous urban cores. Incorporating more frequent observations would also enhance the reliability of time-series analysis, especially for detecting rapid or seasonal changes.

Last, expanding the analysis beyond surface conditions to include water quality metrics, or biodiversity indices could provide a fuller ecological profile. Integrating multiple environmental dimensions would move the assessment closer to ecosystem health evaluation rather than surface characterization alone.
