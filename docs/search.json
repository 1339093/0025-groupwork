    "text": "AUTHOR\n.. Group\n\n\nThis project explores the environmental impacts of rapid urbanization in Shenzhen using remote sensing data and geospatial analysis on the Google Earth Engine platform. By combining vegetation, urban, and water-related indices with auxiliary datasets such as nighttime lights and air pollution, the study offers a multi-dimensional perspective on urban expansion and its ecological consequences.\nThrough a land cover classification and time-series analysis from both monthly and annual scales, the project captures spatial patterns and temporal changes in surface conditions. The results provide valuable references for understanding the balance between urban growth and environmental sustainability, offering practical support for planning and decision-making in urban and ecological management.\n\n\n\n\n\nShenzhen, situated in the Pearl River Delta of southern China, has undergone rapid urbanization and economic transformation over recent decades, transitioning from a small fishing village into a major global metropolis. This rapid urban growth has brought significant economic benefits but also substantial environmental challenges, including increased urban heat islands, reduced vegetation coverage, water quality degradation, and heightened air pollution. Understanding and mitigating these ecological impacts is critical for ensuring sustainable urban development and maintaining quality of life for residents.\n\n\n\nUrbanization significantly alters land surface characteristics, affecting local climate, hydrology, and biodiversity (Seto et al., 2012; Grimm et al., 2008). Zhou et al. (2017) demonstrated a strong link between urban expansion and intensified urban heat island effects, highlighting the role of vegetation in regulating urban microclimates. The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) serves as a robust tool for assessing vegetation health and ecological quality in urban settings (Huete et al., 2002).\nUrban growth often results in the loss of permeable surfaces, increased runoff, and degradation of water quality, phenomena effectively monitored by the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) (Xu, 2006). Likewise, indices such as the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBBI) and the Bare Soil Index (BSI) provide quantitative means to track urban development and its ecological implications (Zha et al., 2003).\nNighttime light imagery has emerged as a valuable proxy for urbanization intensity and human activity, correlating well with energy use and environmental pressures (Elvidge et al., 2013). The increasing availability of time-series satellite data, particularly from Landsat and MODIS, has further enabled the analysis of long-term urban ecological trends and seasonal variations (Weng et al., 2014).\nIn addition, studies have shown a close relationship between urban land expansion and atmospheric pollutants, including NO₂ concentrations, especially in rapidly growing metropolitan areas (Zheng et al., 2018). With the integration of remote sensing and machine learning approaches such as Random Forest classifiers, the precision of land cover mapping has improved considerably, supporting more detailed and scalable urban ecological assessments (Belgiu & Drăguţ, 2016).\n\n\n\n\nHow does urbanization impact ecological conditions in the Shenzhen region?\nObjective: To develop an interactive application using high-resolution and multi-temporal remote sensing techniques to assess the ecological impacts of urbanization in Shenzhen. By integrating spectral indices such as NDBBI, EVI, BSI, MNDWI, and LST with machine learning classification, the project identifies land cover changes (e.g., vegetation loss, surface temperature rise, water body shrinkage) and analyzes their correlation with urban expansion, aiming to support evidence-based urban planning and environmental management.\n\n\n\nUrban planners, environmental agencies, and local policymakers in Shenzhen\nThis application is designed to support urban planning departments and ecological management agencies by providing accurate, timely, and spatially-explicit data on the ecological effects of urbanization. By visualizing key indicators such as vegetation coverage (EVI), land surface temperature (LST), and impervious surface extent (NDBBI), the platform helps stakeholders monitor ecological changes, identify vulnerable areas, and evaluate the effectiveness of urban greening or mitigation strategies. The insights also empower policy decisions related to sustainable development, land-use regulation, climate adaptation, and public health interventions in rapidly urbanizing areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Type\nDataset & Source\nUsage\nTime Period\n\n\n\n\nLand Surface Reflectance & Temperature\nLANDSAT/LC08/C02/T1_L2 – USGS Landsat 8 Collection 2 Tier 1 Level 2\nUsed to calculate EVI, NDBBI, BSI, MNDWI, NDMVI, and LST\n2013–2023 (Classification based on 2020)\n\n\nDigital Elevation Model & Slope/Aspect\nUSGS/SRTMGL1_003 – NASA SRTM DEM (30 m)\nUsed for slope, aspect and terrain correction of EVI\nStatic (Global DEM)\n\n\nNighttime Lights\nNOAA/VIIRS/DNB/MONTHLY_V1/VCMSLCFG – VIIRS Monthly DNB\nUsed to assess urban activity and monthly urbanization trends\n2013–2023\n\n\nTropospheric NO₂ Column\nCOPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3_NO2 – Sentinel-5P TROPOMI\nUsed to evaluate urban-related air pollution\n2018–2023\n\n\nAdministrative Boundaries\nFAO/GAUL_SIMPLIFIED_500m/2015/level2 – FAO GAUL Level 2\nUsed to define the region of interest (Shenzhen)\nStatic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlow chart\nHow are you using this data to address the problem?\n\n\n\nReplace the link below with the link to your application.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUse this section to explain how your application works using code blocks and text explanations (no more than 500 words excluding code):\n本研究的地表覆盖分类体系是以2020年深圳地区的遥感数据为基础建立的，结合当年城市空间格局与生态特征，设计了包括植被、建设用地、水体和裸地在内的指标体系，通过阈值规则实现多类别地表识别。\n分类精度通过与人工标注验证样本的对比，构建混淆矩阵，并计算总体精度、Kappa系数、生产者精度和用户精度等指标进行量化验证。\nMap.setCenter(35.51898, 33.90153, 15);\n\nMap.setOptions(\"satellite\");\n\nvar aoi = ee.Geometry.Point(35.51898, 33.90153).buffer(3000);\nYou can include images:\n\n\n\nPixelwise T-Test, 2018\n\n\nand math: \\[ \\Large ... \\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelgiu, M., & Drăguţ, L.
